Create a C++ class that is a fortran array with the class methods being:
- Constructor with args specifying dimensions: allocate memory
- Add element with args being the element position + new element: assign the element to the array position
- Delete element with args being element position: remove the element from the array position
- Finalizer: deallocate memory
- Print all elements

Implementation:
- All arrays are nodes in a singly linked list with pos being the position in it. This means that any operation from C++ will at least be O(n) since we need to retrieve the array from the list.
- Each array operation defined in Fortran will have its own pointers so that array fetching is done once for each array used in the operation.
- Git the project once we have all the 1-2D basics running (specify that function definitions need to be in fortran)
- Have a few sample methods such as scalar multiplication and addition.
- Create a library out of the project

- Later, implement a global pointer that points to last used array node to make array fetching O(1) when using the same array.
- After that, try to increase global pointer count to 5.
